# MVP (Solo) Project

### Overview:

You have 36 hours to produce something compelling using the skills you've honed over the past five weeks.

__Q:__ What are your inputs?
<br>
__A:__ 36 hours of (relatively) undivided attention

__Q:__ What is the required output?
<br>
__A:__ A compelling product presentation delivered to your classmates.


### Getting Started:

To build on your learning of core engineering concepts, we will begin thinking about how to actually manage projects. Engineering management is a deep skill and discipline with lots of history and academic writing. We will focus on just some highlights of content to give a very brief context of how we arrive here.

* Use an [Iterative and incremental development process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development) instead of a [Waterfall Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)

## Basic Requirements
- [x] Fork the [repo](https://github.com/telegraphacademy/2015-06-mvp)
- Complete the README.md template (<30min)
  - [x] Pick an idea (implement a technology, build a product, make art, etc).
  - [x] Write it down on paper
  - [ ] Imagine what portion of this could be done in 24 hours.
  - [ ] Cut the scope in half.
  - [ ] Cut the above scope in half again.
  - [ ] Fill in the README.md template document
- [ ] Use iterative development (go straight to something that demo's your idea)
- [ ] Prepare for pitch @ demo on Tuesday

## Extra Credit

- [ ] Storage - if your app persists data, use a tool like Parse or Firebase.
- [ ] Use Liberator, then deploy your app so the whole world can see!
- [ ] If applicable, use an MVC Framework - Make your app production grade with a full-on MVC.

> This material was originally posted [here](http://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management). It is reproduced here for posterity's sake.

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Receptacle

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  where does this item need to go?

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  We keep too much stuff around. Sometimes we just need to know where to put it. Receptable's goal is to guide you to places for waste mangement and reuse in Berkeley or Oakland.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Receptable helps users plan and deliver their wastes to places where they become resources. Intelligent prompts and focused pathways guide users to the most effective ways to manage their unwanted items.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  'I was tired of answering this question to my friends. Now ask receptable!'

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Type what you want to send away in the search bar. That's it!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  'I had a box of batteries taking up space in my house and through Receptacle I found a way to get it to the right place"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  'Visit the site today and get rid of stuff now!'
