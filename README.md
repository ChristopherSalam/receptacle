# receptacleMVP

receptacle is a single page application that will allow users to input something they have that they no longer need and give them a starting point for where to go in Berkeley or Oakland to give it a new home or recycle it.

This project should eventually allow for user input but this first iteration will only allow consumer rather than create use. Goals could also include building an API to allow other people in Berkeley and Oakland to have access to this information and use it.

that's it!
